# Camera Functionality Implementation

## Overview
This implementation adds comprehensive camera functionality to the React Native Expo app using `react-native-image-picker`. Users can capture receipts/documents from the Transactions screen and process them through an intuitive editing interface.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Camera Integration
- **Library**: `react-native-image-picker` v8.2.1
- **Trigger**: "Scan" button in `(tabs)/Transactions.tsx`
- **Camera Options**:
  - Back camera by default
  - High-quality photo capture (2000x2000 max)
  - No base64 encoding for performance
  - Temporary storage (not saved to photo library)

### 2. Navigation Flow
```
Transactions Screen → Camera → AfterTake Screen → Back to Transactions
```

### 3. AfterTake Screen Features
- **Consistent Theme**: Uses the same LinearGradient background (`#e0f2fe`, `#bae6fd`, `#7dd3fc`)
- **Image Display**: Prominent, responsive image display with proper aspect ratios
- **Image Information**: Shows file name, size, and dimensions
- **Smooth Animations**: Entrance animations and interaction feedback

### 4. Editing Tools
- **Crop**: Image cropping functionality
- **Filter**: Color filters and enhancements
- **Brightness**: Brightness adjustment controls
- **Contrast**: Contrast modification
- **Rotate**: 90° rotation increments
- **Text**: Text annotation capabilities

### 5. User Experience
- **Clean UI**: No overflow issues, intuitive design
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messages
- **Loading States**: Processing indicators during scan operations
- **Confirmation Dialogs**: Smart navigation with discard confirmations
- **Pro Tips**: Helpful guidance for optimal scanning

### 6. Navigation Controls
- **Back Button**: Returns to previous screen with confirmation
- **Close Button**: Direct navigation to Transactions
- **Retake Option**: Easy re-capture functionality

## File Structure
```
frontend/
├── app/
│   ├── (tabs)/
│   │   └── Transactions.tsx        # Modified with camera trigger
│   └── (afterTake)/
│       └── index.tsx               # New comprehensive editing screen
```

## Technical Implementation

### Camera Launch (Transactions.tsx)
```typescript
const handleScanPress = () => {
  const options = {
    mediaType: 'photo' as MediaType,
    includeBase64: false,
    maxHeight: 2000,
    maxWidth: 2000,
    saveToPhotos: false,
    cameraType: 'back' as const,
  };

  launchCamera(options, (response) => {
    // Handle response and navigate to afterTake
  });
};
```

### Navigation with Parameters
- Passes image data through route parameters
- Includes metadata (filename, size, dimensions)
- Type-safe navigation using expo-router

### Responsive Design
- Adapts to different screen sizes
- Maintains aspect ratios
- Prevents UI overflow on various devices

## Dependencies
- `react-native-image-picker`: Camera functionality
- `expo-linear-gradient`: Background gradients
- `expo-router`: Navigation and routing
- `@expo/vector-icons`: UI icons

## Error Handling
1. **Camera Unavailable**: Graceful degradation with error messages
2. **Permission Denied**: Clear instructions for users
3. **Capture Cancelled**: Silent handling, returns to previous screen
4. **Navigation Errors**: Fallback routes and error boundaries

## Performance Considerations
- No base64 encoding to prevent memory issues
- Image compression for optimal storage
- Lazy loading of editing tools
- Efficient re-renders with proper state management

## Future Enhancements
1. **OCR Integration**: Text extraction from receipts
2. **Cloud Storage**: Save processed images to cloud
3. **Batch Processing**: Multiple image capture
4. **Advanced Filters**: More sophisticated image processing
5. **Machine Learning**: Automatic receipt data extraction

## Usage
1. Navigate to Transactions tab
2. Tap "Scan" button in the action buttons row
3. Allow camera permissions if prompted
4. Capture image using device camera
5. Review and edit image in AfterTake screen
6. Use editing tools to enhance image quality
7. Tap "Scan Receipt" to process the image
8. Choose to add transaction or retake photo
